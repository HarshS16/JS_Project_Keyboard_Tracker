# Keyboard Tracker

## About the Project

**Keyboard Tracker** is a web-based application that detects and displays information about keys pressed on the keyboard. When the application is launched, users are prompted to press any key, and the program dynamically shows the following details:
- **Key Pressed**: The actual key pressed by the user.
- **Key Code**: The numeric code associated with the key.
- **Code**: The standardized representation of the key.

This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript concepts such as events, DOM manipulation, `setInterval`, and arrow functions.
